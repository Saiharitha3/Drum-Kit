#### Why I Chose the GNU GPL License

I have applied the GNU General Public License (GPL) v3 to this repository for the following reasons:

1. ***Software Freedom***  
   - GPL is liberal license that supports the user rights to execute, modify and distribute the software without any hindrance. It helps to guarantee everyone elementary benefits and a possibility for his or her participation in the project.

2. ***Copyleft Protection***  
   - Just like with any other licenses based on the GNU license, one of the main provisions of the GPL is the copyleft provision. From this code, any revisions, improvements or adaptations must be distributed under the GPL license. This ensures that the software is independent and continuously owned by subsequent users without the相關 private impressions and ownership.

3. ***From Encouraging Open Collaboration***  
   - That is why through the GPL I want to get as many contributors as possible who can work on this issue without any restrictions. The license guarantees that added values and variations in turn always remain accessible to all – which is conducive to collective development.

4. ***Transparency and Accessibility*** 
   - The GPL encourages openness for a simple reason that the source code has to be presented every time the software is distributed. What it means is that users can learn how the code functions, check for one or many vulnerabilities and even rewrite some portion of the code if needed.
