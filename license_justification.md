#### The Reasons I choose For MIT License

I have applied the MIT License to this repository for the following reasons:

1. ***Software Freedom***  
   - The MIT License is an open source referencing license which allows users free usage, copying, modification and distribution of the software. This makes it possible for anyone to be allowed to benefit from it as well as be part of the project.

2. ***Flexibility***  
   - The MIT License also permits modifications ad redistributions for any use, including for proprietary purposes. This makes the software to be easily embraced by the users and developers since it is free from restriction and the sources can be easily integrated with other projects without having to influence the license in their projects.

3. ***Open Collaboration – or – How Change Really Happens***  
   - As for the license, I picked the MIT License because I would like the number of contributors to be as large as possible and with as few licensing restrictions as possible. This is because the many restrictions in legal documents have a way of putting off people and make contribution impossible for many people.

4. ***Accessibility***  
   - The MIT License is beneficial also to the third party because it full opens the source for third party use and distribution of the product. Users can now read through the code, assess for possible enhancements, as well as apply them to other projects leading to high levels of openness and engagement.
