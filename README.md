</center>

- This project is a simple web-based Drum Kit where users can interact with different drum sounds by clicking on images or pressing specific keys on the keyboard.

### ✨ ***Features***
- "🎵 **Interactive Drum Images**: Users can click on visually appealing drum images to play corresponding sounds."
- "🎹 **Keyboard Support**: Drum sounds can also be triggered by pressing specific keys (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `J`, `K`, `L`)."
- "📱 **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices."
- "🎨 **Animations**: Keys are visually animated upon pressing, enhancing the user experience with dynamic feedback."

### ⌨️ ***Key Bindings***

- **W**  : Pressing the W key will play the Tom-1 drum sound.
- **A**  : Pressing the A key will play the Tom-2 drum sound.
- **S**  : Pressing the S key will play the Tom-3 drum sound.
- **D**  : Pressing the D key will play the Tom-4 drum sound.
- **J**  : Pressing the J key will play the Snare drum sound.
- **K**  : Pressing the K key will play the Crash cymbal sound.
- **L**  : Pressing the L key will play the Kick Bass drum sound.

### 🔧 **Technologies Used**
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout, including the responsive design and button animations.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for playing sounds and adding visual effects.

### ⚙️ **How It Works**
1. **Clicking Buttons**: Users can click on drum images to play sounds.
2. **Key Presses**: Users can press the designated keys to trigger corresponding drum sounds.
3. **Animation**: The pressed buttons get a temporary animation to enhance the visual experience.

### 📂 **File Structure**
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the page and contains the drum buttons.
- `styles.css`: Contains the styles for the drum kit, including background images, fonts, colors, and button animations.
- `index.js`: JavaScript file handling the event listeners for button clicks and key presses, playing the appropriate sound, and triggering animations.
