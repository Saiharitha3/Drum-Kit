**Drum Kit**
- This project is a simple web-based Drum Kit where users can interact with different drum sounds by clicking on images or pressing specific keys on the keyboard.

**Features**
- **Interactive Drum Images**  : Users can click on drum images corresponding to various drum sounds.
- **Keyboard Support**         : Drum sounds can also be triggered by pressing specific keys on the keyboard (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `J`, `K`, `L`).
- **Responsive Design**        : The drum kit layout adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Animations**               : When keys are pressed, they are visually animated for a better user experience.

**Key Bindings**

- **W**  : Pressing the W key will play the Tom-1 drum sound.
- **A**  : Pressing the A key will play the Tom-2 drum sound.
- **S**  : Pressing the S key will play the Tom-3 drum sound.
- **D**  : Pressing the D key will play the Tom-4 drum sound.
- **J**  : Pressing the J key will play the Snare drum sound.
- **K**  : Pressing the K key will play the Crash cymbal sound.
- **L**  : Pressing the L key will play the Kick Bass drum sound.

**Technologies Used**
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout, including the responsive design and button animations.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for playing sounds and adding visual effects.

**How It Works**

1. **Clicking Buttons**: Users can click on drum images to play sounds.
2. **Key Presses**: Users can press the designated keys to trigger corresponding drum sounds.
3. **Animation**: The pressed buttons get a temporary animation to enhance the visual experience.

**File Structure**

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the page and contains the drum buttons.
- `styles.css`: Contains the styles for the drum kit, including background images, fonts, colors, and button animations.
- `index.js`: JavaScript file handling the event listeners for button clicks and key presses, playing the appropriate sound, and triggering animations.

3.	Open the Project in a Browser:
-	Since the project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser:
- If you are using the command line, you can open the file directly:

4.	Enjoy Playing the Drum Kit:
-	Once the page loads in your browser, you can interact with the drum kit by either clicking on the images or pressing the keys (W, A, S, D, J, K, L) to play different drum sounds.
  
-	No additional setup or dependencies are required, as the project runs purely on client-side web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
